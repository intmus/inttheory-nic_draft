**Pentatonic Scales Tricks**

-Take out the tri-tone notes (Degree 4 and 7) from the major scale for major pentatonic.

-Minor pentatonic can be remembered as taking out scale degree 2 and 6.

-Major and Minor are the same pitches, but just organized in a different order (different starting point). They are modes of each other.

**Bobby McFerrin Video**

He could demonstrate that the pentatonic scale can be used independently and easily taught. 

Even though it is missing the two notes that we considered important scale degrees, if can still be expressive and interesting (and it is in our bones). 

###Notes Continued on Wednesday September 1, 2021. 

Mixed Modes
Lydian Dominant (Do,Re, Mi, Fi, So, La, Te, Do). Compared to major, we have a raised 4th (fi) and a lowered 7th (Te). 
Lydian Dominant, rather than Lydian Mixolydian. Easier to say. Very useful for dealing with altered chords (we will get to that).

How to practice/learn the modes: for example, F Phrygian
1: (Relative): What scale is F the ^3 of?
2: (Parallel): What tones are altered in a Phyrgian Scale?

How to find Phrygian Dominant: Build a domninat scale upon the ^5 of the Phrygian scale. (a.k.a the locrian scale).

### The Chromatic Scale ###

The chromatic scale consists entirely of half steps, and uses every pitch on the keyboard within a single octave. Here is the chromatic scale that spans the pitches C4 through C5.
