# Class discussion

**Standard progressions using the bII**
- You can spell this chord enharmonically! We see this in the third mini-example within this example. The Ab in the tenor is changed to a G# in order to make the voice leading make more sense--we go to an A next, so seeing a G# is easier to read
- bII6 is going to be the most common version of this chord you see. You can also write it as N6, but we suggest bII6 because that actually informs its function (predominant, just like a regular ii!)
- A root position bII has...problems
  - We've introduced *ra*, which wants to resolve down because it's a flattened *re*. So, when it's followed by a V(7), we either have to have parallel octaves or have a tendency tone resolve in the wrong direction (ra skipping down to ti or going up to re because there's no do in V. gross)
- bII6 - iv sounds super cool!
  - There's only a half-step difference which makes voice leading a dream (le down to sol)
- bII6 in the 20th century starts to get weird, functionally. Mahler used it just as a color
- bII6 is mode mixture: it's borrowed from Phrygian mode
