# Class discussion

**Double Neighbor Tones** 
Decorates a single pitch, has to come back to the original pitch.
- Enclosure! It doesnt matter if you to up or down first, but there is a stepwise note above and below.
- Two neighbor tones stapled together.
 
**Appoggiatura (APP)** 
Approached by leap and left by step in the opposite direction.

**Escape Tone (ET)**
Approached by step and left by leap in the opposite direction.

*appoggiaturas and escape tones are the most common NCT's*

**Anticipations (ANT)**
A reverse suspension, although not upsidedown like retardations. Putting your car in reverse doesn't put it on its roof.
- A chord tone that shows up too early.
- Its going to be a chord tone soon, but not yet because the chord hasn't changed yet.
- Static motion!

**Pedals (PED)**
Any non chord tone approached by static motion and left by static motion across at least three chords. When labeling with a pedal, use the next voice up to determine inversion.

**"Figure"**
It has the right shape, but aren't non-chord tones. This concept can apply to any NCT. Check if they're chord tones!
*ex: There's an appoggiatura figure in [insert random piece], measure 21.
