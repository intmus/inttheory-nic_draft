# Class discussion

**Double Neighbor Tones** 
Decorates a single pitch, has to come back to the original pitch.
- Enclosure! It doesnt matter if you to up or down first, but there is a stepwise note above and below.
- Two neighbor tones stapled together.

**Incomplete Neighbor Group/Tone**
- Use as a last resort. 
- Happens when you have a normal neighbor group or neighbor tone, but the approach and resolution are not the same note. 
- Only use when there isn't another option. 
- For incomplete neighbor tones, unlike either appogiaturas or escape tones,you don't have to resolve in the opposite direction. 
- If you have a lot of incomplete neighbor tones and groups, you're probably not in the right tonality. 
 
**Appoggiatura (APP)** 
Approached by leap and left by step in the opposite direction.

**Escape Tone (ET)**
Approached by step and left by leap in the opposite direction.

*appoggiaturas and escape tones are the most common NCT's*
*make sure to remember which is which*

**Anticipations (ANT)**
A reverse suspension, although not upsidedown like retardations. Putting your car in reverse doesn't put it on its roof.
- A chord tone that shows up too early.
- Its going to be a chord tone soon, but not yet because the chord hasn't changed yet.
- Resolved by static motion.
- Preparation can be a leap or a step, doesn't matter too much.

**Pedals (PED)**
Any non chord tone approached by static motion and left by static motion across at least three chords. When labeling with a pedal, use the next voice up to determine inversion.

**"Figure"**
It has the right shape, but aren't non-chord tones. This concept can apply to any NCT. Check if they're chord tones!
*ex: There's an appoggiatura figure in [insert random piece], measure 21.
