# Class discussion

**Add a double neighbor tone example that doesn't change chords**

**Review definition of anticipation. Usually approached by step but not always**

Retardation- the upwards suspension

Double Neighbor Tones- Decorates a single pitch, has to come back to the original pitch

 -Enclosure! it doesnt matter if you to up or down first, but there is a stepwise note above and below
 
 -Two neighbor tones stapled together
 
Appoggiatura- approached by leap and left by step in the opposite direction

Escape tone- approached by step and left by leap in the opposite direction

Anticipations- A reverse suspension. Not upsidedown like retardations. Putting your car in reverse doesn't put it on its roof.

-A chord tone that shows up too early

-Its going to be a chord tone soon, but not yet because the chord hasn't changed yet

-Static motion!

"Figure"- It has the right shape, but aren't non-chord tones
