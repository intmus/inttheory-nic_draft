## Class discussion 

There are three parts: Preparation (before non chord tone), the non-chord tone itself, and the resolution (note after the non-chord tone).
  - The preparation and resolutions are always chord tones. If there are multiple non-chord tones, it means you have analyzed something an the pattern is wrong.
  
 Non-chord tones can be:
 - Accented vs unaccented 
 - On-chord vs off-chord 
 - Chromatic vs diatonic 
 - Ascending vs descending (passing tones only)
 - Upper vs lower (neighbor tones only)
 
 **Passing Tone (PT)** Is approached by step and left by step in the same direction. Ex: Both preparation and resolution are moving down(or the opposite direction). 
 
 **Neighbor Tone (NT)** Is approached by step and left by step in the opposite direction. Ex: The preparation moves down and the resolution returns back up(or the opposite for each). 
 
 **Suspension (SUS)** Is approached by static motion and resolves downward by step. All suspensions require two chords as the preparation will be on a different chord than the NTC itself. We label how suspensions resolve with its intervalic label. Anything above the bass voice, your write the interval of the two notes of the suspension against the bass note. Ex: C in the bass with a D to C resolution in the tenor voice is a "Sus 9-8." The most common suspensions are 4-3, 7-6, 9-8.
