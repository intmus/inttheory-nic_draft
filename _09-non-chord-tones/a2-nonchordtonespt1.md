## Class discussion 

There are three parts: Preparation (before non chord tone), the non-chord tone itself, and the resolution (note after the non-chord tone).
  - The preparation and resolutions are always chord tones. If there are multiple non-chord tones, it means you have analyzed something an the pattern is wrong.
  
 Non-chord tones can be:
 - Accented vs unaccented 
 - On-chord vs off-chord 
 - Chromatic vs diatonic 
 - Ascending vs descending (passing tones only)
 - Upper vs lower (neighbor tones only)
 
 **Passing Tone (PT)** Is approached by step and left by step in the same direction. Ex: Both preparation and resolution are moving down(or the opposite direction). 
 
 **Neighbor Tone (NT)** Is approached by step and left by step in the opposite direction. Ex: The preparation moves down and the resolution returns back up(or the opposite for each). 
 
 **Suspension (SUS)** Is approached by static motion and resolves downward by step. **All suspensions require two chords** as the preparation will be on a different chord than the NCT itself. You have to have this downward motion. If you don't, you may have to alter the chord when inserting a suspension. We label how suspensions resolve with its intervalic label. Anything above the bass voice, you write the interval of the two notes of the suspension against the bass note.Ex: C in the bass with a D to C resolution in the alto voice is a "Sus 9-8." If this example occurs in the tenor voice, it is considered 2-1. The most common suspensions are 4-3, 7-6, 9-8. 
 
If the suspension is in the bass, you measure it against the most dissonant voice. They will always be labeled 2-3 because there will always be a second. Also note that the numbers get bigger when labeling. (4-3 vs 2-3)
 
**Retardation (RET)** Is approached by static motion and resolves upward by step. You can think of it as a suspension that resolves up. It follows all of the same rules. These are much **less** common.
