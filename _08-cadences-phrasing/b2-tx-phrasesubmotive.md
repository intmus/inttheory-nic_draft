# Class Discussion

## Identifying Phrases ##
- Look for rests
- Listen for a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Look for cadential chords; I, V, and vi. A cadence is like the period at the end of a sentence.
- Look for structure. Sometimes, phrases stay the same length, and this can make it a lot easier to separate the different phrases.
